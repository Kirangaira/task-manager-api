<h1>Task Manager REST API</h1>
This is a full featured Task Management REST API back-end built with Node.js and MongoDB. Features include:
<ul>
  <li> Full CRUD features for User and Task instances. </li>
  <li> Pagination and filtering of server responses to avoid slow page load times. </li>
  <li> Hash encryption of passwords and access management with JWT tokens.</li>
  <li> Restricted user access to CRUD operations using middleware based on JWT tokens. </li>
</ul>

## What I Used:
<ul>
<li> Express(for Restful API and managing routers). </li>
<li> Mongoose(NoSql database). </li>
<li>Validations.</li>
<li>Async-Await (for waitting until the process is done!).</li>
<li>JWT(for authenticating users).</li>
<li>multer(image uploading). </li>
<li>sharp(croping and image formatter). </li>
<li>SendGrid API (for sending emails).</li>
<li>heroku (deployment). </li>
</ul>
